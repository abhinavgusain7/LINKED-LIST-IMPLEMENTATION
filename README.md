##(Description of the program is to create a modular and efficient program in C for implementing a Singly Linked List with Insertion (at the beginning, at the end, and after a given node), Deletion (by value), Traversal (to display the linked list). This task demonstrates how to manage dynamic memory, pointer manipulation, and struct-based data structures in C. Tools used while making this program is c language or implementing pointers, structures, and linked list operations. compiler for Converts the human-written C code into machine-executable code. and the vs code text editor is used while making it. Task is applicable for data structure learning for it is a fundamental exercise in understanding linked list data structures, which are essential for technical interviews, competitive programming, and academic coursework ,Real-World Applications(Memory management systems, Dynamic data storage, Networking, Operating systems), Software Development for Used in building custom dynamic data structures where flexibility is required, and array-based structures are not efficient. this is the description of that program.
